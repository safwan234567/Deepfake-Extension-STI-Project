# Security-Technology-and-Innovation-Project

Background
============

We are a group of 4 students researching on Deepfake and the ways to detect it. Our current iteration of the project is using an API from Deepware, and can be deployed on browser extensions. With the rising trends of Deepfake, it is becoming more difficult for the majority of people to distinguish between properly implemented Deepfaked videos and their original counterparts. As a result, we thought it would be interesting to research into the ways to detect and stop Deepfake.

Features
=========
- Deployed as browser extensions
- Supports Youtube, Facebook, and Twitter
- Automatically detects videos and notifies the user

Future Implementations
